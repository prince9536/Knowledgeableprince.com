  <h1>History of “Amazon.com”</h1><br>
  <p>The company was founded in 1994, spurred by what Bezos called his “regret minimization framework”, which described his efforts to
    fend off any regrets for not participating sooner in the Internet business boom during that time. In 1994, Bezos left his employment
    as vice-president of D. E. Shaw & Co., a Wall Street firm, and moved to Seattle. He began to work on a business plan for what would
    eventually become Amazon.com.</p><br><br>

  <h1>About the Owner of the Amazon Comapany</h1>

  <div class="Owner">
    <div class="owner1">
      <p>Jeff Bezos , byname of Jeffrey Preston Bezos, (born January 12, 1964, Albuquerque, New Mexico, U.S.), American
        entrepreneur
        who played a key role in the growth of e-commerce as the founder and chief executive officer of Amazon.com,
        Inc., an online
        merchant of books and later of a wide variety of products. Under his guidance, Amazon became the largest
        retailer on the
        World Wide Web and the model for Internet sales.</p>
      <p> In 1993 Bezos married Mackenzie Tuttle, whom he had met at D.E. Shaw. The couple announced in January 2019
        that they were
        divorcing, and the following day the National Enquirer printed a story revealing that Bezos was having an affair
        with another
        woman. Bezos subsequently launched an investigation into how the tabloid had obtained his private text messages.
        Then, in February, he posted a lengthy essay online in which he accused officials at American Media Inc. (AMI),
        the parent
        company of the Enquirer, of “extortion and bribery” for suggesting that they would release nude photographs of
        Bezos if he
        did not stop his inquiry, amid other demands. The Bezos-led investigation later alleged that his lover’s brother
        had
        leaked the texts.</p>
